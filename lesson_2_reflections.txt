What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

You create an empty Git repository or reinitialize an existing one. We need to
do this to be able to commit future changes and save file's history through
Git commits.


How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is where you put the changes you are planning to make, but have
not made yet into. This is useful because it allows you to gather all the
planned changes without affecting the main body of code before you are ready,
or commit them into logical batches to make it more clear on what you are trying
to change.


How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?

You can do this by putting all of the changes per logical change in the staging
area and checking through it before committing them while leaving your other
changes in the working directory. This allows you to commit some of the changes
you need to do while preserving your earlier work to be checked in later.


How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

Diagrams help visualize the branch structure by showing at what point in time
the branch diverts from the main source of code.
