When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

Using a remote repository instead of keeping all your work local lets you work
on the same body of code from different computers. It also gives you an online
saved copy of all your work so if something happens to the local copy it is safe
 and allows you to share this code with other people.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

You may want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git do it
automatically because your local changes might have conflicts with the remote
repository that you are not yet ready to resolve.
